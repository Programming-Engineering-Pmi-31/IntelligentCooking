In a second bowl, combine the tahini sauce (tahini, honey, coconut oil, vanilla, salt, cardamom, cinnamon and sesame seeds), and heat the mixture slightly until warm but not bubbly.  Pour the tahini sauce over the base ingredients, and stir to combine. Bake. Spread the granola out evenly on a large parchment-covered baking sheet.  Bake for 25 minutes, stirring once halfway through.  Then sprinkle the coconut evenly over the top of the granola (if using), bake for 5-10 more minutes until toasted, and transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack and let it cool completely to room temperature without stirring. Break it up.  At this point, you can break the granola up into your desired size of clumps.  (I love mine extra clumpy!) Serve.

For even cooking, be sure to have them cut into evenly-sized chunks (about 1-inch wide). Boil the potatoes.  The usual method — place the potatoes in a large pot, cover with cold water, bring to a boil, simmer until tender, then drain. Prepare your melted butter mixture.  While the potatoes are cooking, heat the butter, buttermilk, salt and pepper together in the microwave (or a small saucepan) until the butter is just melted.  (You want to avoid boiling the buttermilk.) Pan-dry the potatoes.  Once the potatoes have been drained, immediately return them to the hot stockpot, place it back on the hot burner, and turn the heat down to low.  Using two oven mitts, carefully hold the handles on the stockpot and shake it gently on the burner for about 1 minute.  This step will help cook off some of the remaining steam within the potatoes. Mash the potatoes.  Using your preferred kind of potato masher (I recommend this one in general, or this one for extra-smooth), mash the potatoes to your desired consistency.  Then stir the herbs into the melted butter mixture until combined, then gradually fold the butter mixture and cream cheese into the mashed potatoes.  As always, try not to overmix the potatoes to prevent them from turning gummy. Taste and season.  One final time, taste the potatoes and season with extra salt and pepper as needed.
